# Scripting vs Coding
* Scripting is the process of adding functionality to programs, with a heavy emphasis on automation.
* Whereas coding is used to make a program, scripting is used to make the program more dynamic - scripts do not make programs, they operate within already made programs
* Scripts are always 1 file and do not need to be compiled , unlike programs
* Scripts are always used to fulfill a specific task, programs do many things
* Scripts are almost always written in 'high level languages' (easy to read) - Python, Bash,  Ruby

## How are scripts used?
* Scripting is primarily used to automate tasks for webpages and web applications
* Used to add interactivity to webpages by adding features such as visualization interfaces 
* Scripting languages contain different libraries, which help to create new applications in web browsers. They are different from normal programming languages

### Advantages of scripting
* Easier to learn than coding
* Fast editing - due to using fewer variables and data structures, it is easier to make changes
* Can port easily between different operating systems
* It directly executes the files without needing compilation but sometimes may be required to compile when necessary
* It is an open-source platform that makes capable of users to view and edit the script when required
* As compared to an actual program, it is much faster to develop

## Why use Python?
* Open source
* Many libraries (allow us to do things in few lines)
* Easy to understand
* Large community (often times script we want is already written)
* Language interoperability (can talk to other languages, OS's and software) e.g. using python to allow C to talk to other C derived languages

## Why is scripting used in DevOps?
Scripting is essential to DevOps due to the automation it provides, and below are some examples:
1) Can automate crud process
2) Can automate ip fetching
3) Can check certificate expiry dates
4) Can check grammar and spelling
5) Can extract the source code in webpages
6) Can parse webpages
7) Can convert images to text
8) Can generate secure passwords
9) Can send phone SMS automatically
10) Can run CMD commands on python
